class MetropolisHastings:
    """
    A Metropolis-Hastings acceptance function for GerryChain. This acceptance
    function tends to reward more 'fit' plans, where fitness is defined by a
    weighted sum of various score functions on partitions. By default, the
    following score functions are included in the weight function:
    - Compactness ('cut_edges')
    - Population equality ('pop_mattingly')

    We include these by default because in the absence of constraints on
    population equality and compactness, the plans produced by Gerrychain
    proposals will not be good samples from the distribution of appropriate
    districting maps. Additionallly, the user can choose to include any of the
    following score functions in the fitness function:

    - Other methods for scoring population equality:
        - using the max-min of district populations ('pop_max-min')

    - Custom score functions, specified by the 'custom' argument, which must
      accept a GerryChain partition and return a nonnegative float (where 0
      indicates the most fit partition).

    If the chain has an election updater, specified with 'election' argument:
    - Any of the metrics already included in GerryChain (partisan_bias,
      partisan_gini, efficiency_gap, mean_median, wins)
    - Partisan dislocation ('partisan_dislocation') (speed up by using the
      AssignmentArray updater)

    If the chain has a CountySplits or CountySplitsSimple updater:
    - County splits: the number of splits ('county_splits_simple'), or
      Mattingly's county split score function ('county_splits_mattingly')

    If the chain has a polsby_popper updater
    - Other methods for calculating compactness:
        - using mean Polsby Popper score ('pp_mean')
        - using max Polsby Popper score ('pp_max')
        - using Mattingly's Polsby Popper method ('pp_mattingly')

    The resulting function will allow the Markov chain to sample from a weighted
    distribution rather than sampling from the uniform distribution. It may also
    allow the chain to explore the sample space more freely, because there is no
    hard cutoff, but rather a 'slope' of acceptability.
