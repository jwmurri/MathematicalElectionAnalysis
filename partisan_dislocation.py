class AssignmentArray:

    GerryChain's 'Assignment' class is optimized for working with the different
    'parts' of an assignment -- i.e. the groupings of precincts contained within
    each district. However, it is comparatively slow for lookup of individual
    precinct assignments. For that use, storing the assignment as a numpy array
    is far more effective. This class provides the way to do that as a
    gerrychain updater.
